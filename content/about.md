Filmulator is a raw photo editing application with library management focusing on

* Simplicity over flexibility
* Ease of learning
* Streamlined workflow

Filmulator accepts raw files from cameras and simulates the development of film as if exposed to the same light as the camera's sensor. This brings about several benefits:

* Large bright regions become darker, compressing the output dynamic range.
* Small bright regions make their surroundings darker, enhancing local contrast.
* In bright regions, saturation is enhanced, helping retain color in bright skies, brighter skin tones, and sunsets.
* In extremely saturated regions, the brightness is attenuated, helping retain detail e.g. in flowers.

If you're familiar with film development techniques, this is what you get from *stand development*, except with color too.

This film simulation helps users achieve great results with less effort.
